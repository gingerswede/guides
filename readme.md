#Guides
This is an index for different guides hosted in this repository. Click on the link to get to the guide that interests you. These guides are based on my (or the authers) experience and in some cases scientific trials/research.

All guides published here are free to use in both educational purposes and profit based purposes. But if they are used a clear source of where they were found must be made and the authors name (if available) must be stated. You are also free to make push requests with your own guide or with changes to existing guides. These will be read and approved if they are concidered thurough enoug and of a topic that needs a guide.
